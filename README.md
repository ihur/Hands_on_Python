## Introduction to Python

Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))).


## Python Installation

1. Download and install Anaconda 2.7.
    1) for Windows from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows).
    2) for Macs from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos).

2. Select the default options when prompted during the installation of Anaconda.

3. Add Python and Conda to path
  1) for Windows by using the setx command
  2) for Macs by using the export command


## Introduction to Jupyter Notebook

Notebooks are documents produced by the Jupyter Notebook App, which contain both computer code (e.g. python) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etcâ€¦). Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis (from [Jupyter_notebook_beginner's_guide](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)).
